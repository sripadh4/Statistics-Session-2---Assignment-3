Probability distribution of two balls from an urn of 10 balls of which 4 are red and 6 are blue

Red_Balls = 4
Black_Balls = 6
Total_Balls = range(1, 11)
No_of_Outcome = range(1, 3)
for i in Total_Balls:
    a = reduce(operator.)
N_Factorial = ((10 * 9)/(2))
Prob_Two_RB = (((4 * 3) / (2)) / N_Factorial)
Prob_Two_BB = (((6 * 5) / (2)) / N_Factorial)
Prob_One_RB_BB = ((4 * 6) / N_Factorial)
print (Prob_Two_RB)
print (Prob_Two_BB)
print (Prob_One_RB_BB)
